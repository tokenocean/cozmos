      Basic Terms and Conditions
    </h1>
    <p>
      Terms and Conditions govern the contractual relationship between you and
      your users and set the way in which your product, service or content may
      be used, in a legally binding way. It is essential for protecting your
      content from a copyright perspective as well as protecting you from
      potential liabilities. <strong
        >Terms typically contain copyright clauses, disclaimers and terms of
        sale, allow you to set governing law, list mandatory consumer protection
        clauses, and more.</strong

    <p>
      Because the Terms & Conditions document is essentially a legally binding
      agreement; it is, therefore, not only important to have one in place, but
      also necessary to ensure that it meets legal requirements. This means that
      the document must be up-to-date with all applicable regulations, precise,
      visible and easily understandable so that users can both easily see it and
      agree to it. The “agreeing action” should be done in an unambiguous way
      (e.g. clicking a checkbox with a visible link to the document before being
      able to create an account or use the service). While the full content may
      vary based on the particulars of your business, the Terms and Conditions
      should at least include the following:
    </p>
